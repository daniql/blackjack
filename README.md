**Blackjack App for Design Spec**

1. USER’S HAND

The game starts by automatically dealing the user two random cards and outputting the result, eg:
Ace of Spades
7 of Diamonds

Then prompt the user to ask if they want to draw another card, and continue prompting to draw cards (and showing the card drawn) until they go over 21, or until the user decides to stop. 
If the user gets a blackjack (exactly 21) then they win, and the game is over. If they went over 21 then they bust and the game ends. If they stop with a score of less than 21, then hand out cards for the dealer.
Be sure to output each card and the user’s total numeric hand score each time.

2. DEALER’S HAND

The dealer’s hand should then be randomly generated by simply drawing cards one at a time until the dealer has a total hand of 16 or more, or until the dealer busts (goes over 21).
Be sure to output each card and the dealer’s total numeric hand score each time.

3. OUTPUT FINAL RESULT

If the dealer gets a blackjack (exactly 21) then the dealer wins. 
If the dealer went over 21 then the dealer loses, user wins
If the dealer stopped with less than 21 score then whoever has the higher total score wins
